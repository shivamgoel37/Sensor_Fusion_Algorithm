# Sensor_Fusion_Algorithm
This project collects data from various sensors (some of the values may contain error). The collected data is passed through a series of computaional steps to  obtain a fused value as per the algorithms. We also get a list of sensors whose values are out of range.

The algorithm is an implementation of the following paper:
